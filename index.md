I am a PhD student at the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I joined in October 2016. My supervisors are [Professor George Danezis](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Danezis/) and [Dr Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/).

My research interests include the intersections of peer-to-peer systems, distributed ledgers and information security.
